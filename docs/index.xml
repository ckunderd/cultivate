      <description>WHAT IT MEANS TO ABIDE We are a community amongst and within other communities. We go about our daily lives with the intent of being faithful to God and encouraging others to do the same.
By community, we mean families and individuals located throughout the world connected by the Holy Spirit and like mindedness who share in the friendship and brotherhood of Jesus Christ. We do not necessarily attend the same church or live in the same city yet we share the same Lord.</description>

      <description>Over several years, Donna McCauley has developed friendships with men and women on the streets of Detroit and families who need encouragement in their faith. Donna, along with her 70x7 team of friends who have a long term commitment to encouraging others, spend time with these individuals and families on a weekly basis. Encouragement is given in the form of friendship, dignity, bible study, prayer and the meeting of a few basic needs, all with the view of helping individuals and families navigate away from at-risk activities and toward Jesus.</description>

      <description>For over 20 years, Mike and Robyn Carnill have committed their lives to strengthening the relationships of others with Jesus, which is the basis of Abide. Whether it happens through one-on-one discipleship, prayer, solitude retreats, deep friendships, or some other way, Mike and Robyn desire to see anyone who is willing to listen to Jesus come to live more fully in him.
Throughout its history, Abide has changed and grown, reminiscent of the vine growing from the branch that Jesus desires our lives to be.</description>

      <description>Since 2013 Beholders has been training believers on how to cultivate a life that attracts the presence of God and to walk in a lifestyle of Spirit-led evangelism. Led by Aaron and Adrianne Jackson, Beholders believes to grow as a messenger one must go out and share the message. It’s in the mission field that people learn to partner with the Holy Spirit and get set free from fear.
Beholders trains by creating worship opportunities where believers can come behold the Father’s heart, because they believe when one beholds something, one becomes like it.</description>

      <description>Cam Underdown is a pastor and director of Cultivate, a ministry devoted to developing people, plans, and prayer support to grow God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom.
Cultivate looks for people who are desiring to move the kingdom of God forward, and serve them in any way possible. Maybe it’s starting a brand new endeavor with a visionary college student to meet an injustice. Maybe it’s partnering with an existing ministry to build a new team that will help that ministry meet its next God-given goal.</description>

      <description>Joshua and Yvette Rock have been living in Detroit for the past 16 years, building friendships and raising their family, hoping to witness and encourage God’s restoration among the people and in the neighborhoods of Detroit. Restoring has developed out of this desire, as a way to support and encourage friends in the process of believing, following, submitting, and abiding in Jesus. As Joshua and Yvette share life with their friends in the city, they work to strengthen marriages and families, meet with men and women, and serve their neighbors in practical ways.</description>

      <description>Transplanters enables synergy between foundations and pioneering non-profit leaders. These leaders are pioneers because they sacrifice everything in pursuit of their innovative ideas. Transplanters serves these leaders by performing development services including grant writing and consulting on organizational structure, systems and priorities.
In addition, Transplanters serves foundations by providing exceptional project management and reporting, as well as the opportunity to align with well-managed, highly-influential non-profits.
Dave and Kris McKenney developed the skills that shape Transplanters while performing award-winning service for Habitat for Humanity affiliates around the country in various volunteer, board, and staff positions.</description>
