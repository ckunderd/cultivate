title: Classes
description: Currently, we offer four different classes. We routinely offer Bible 101, a 12-week course designed to help someone read or skim through the entire Bible, getting the overall message and seeing how the Scriptures point to Christ. In addition, we offer Apologetics (to understand the logical arguments for the Christian faith, especially in regards to attacks on its legitimacy), Hermeneutics (a study on the interpretation of Scripture), and Spiritual Gifts (a collaborative approach to understanding spiritual gifts while meeting people who are mature in using those gifts to grow Godâ€™s kingdom). Classes generally meet once per week for 90 minutes and are discussion based, with varying amounts of study outside of class.
