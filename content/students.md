We are looking for people who are faithful, available, and teachable to join our network and grow in their character, understanding, and leadership. In order to best do this, we suggest:

- Meeting weekly with a mentor (we can help connect you with a mentor)
- Attending a weekly class (such as spiritual gifts, apologetics, or biblical interpretation)
- Serving within an existing campus ministry or campus organization (with the hope of welcome people to follow Jesus)
- Attending occasional trainings on personality type, leadership styles, and other assessment tools

We recognize it’s a large commitment, but over the last 5 years, we have seen those who want to see God’s Kingdom grow become well equipped to do so through this commitment.
