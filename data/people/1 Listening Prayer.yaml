title: Listening Prayer
description: Using Mark Virklerâ€™s Hearing the Voice of God curriculum, we establish that God still speaks to us today in revelatory ways, with Scripture as the guiding light for illuminating the legitimacy of what we experience in listening prayer. Listening prayer times meet once a week at least, and are facilitated by people with experience in the spiritual discipline of prayer, so there is always someone to verify what someone believes they have heard or felt from God.
