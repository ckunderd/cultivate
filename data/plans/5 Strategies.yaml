title: Strategies
description: Strategies are the methods that people or teams use to accomplish their mission. Strategies are deeply informed by values, often coming to light as a result of defining the values. Jesus’ strategies for establishing the Kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven included showing deep compassion to those in need, healing the sick, delivering the demon-afflicted, proclaiming the truth of God, and laying down one’s life for one’s friends. His methods inform our methods; whenever we think about strategies for a person or team, we are asking the question, “What would Jesus do in this situation?” From this fundamental question we can discern the strategies that will grow God’s Kingdom.
