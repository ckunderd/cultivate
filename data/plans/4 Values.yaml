title: Values
description: Values are descriptive qualities that define how the work looks when it is accomplished. When building a house, the mission is clear - construct the house. However, values define how the house looks. Is the house warm and inviting? Environmentally friendly? Disability accessible? These are just a few of the words that can shape every aspect of the construction process. Individuals and teams need to have values in mind in order to properly shape the plan God has for them, and God has many values that we can emulate in our plans - kind, generous, beautiful, and focused on the vulnerable are just a few. Values color every aspect of a plan, making their way into every strategy, goal, and objective.
