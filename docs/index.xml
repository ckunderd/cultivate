      <description>WHAT IT MEANS TO ABIDE We are a community amongst and within other communities. We go about our daily lives with the intent of being faithful to God and encouraging others to do the same.
By community, we mean families and individuals located throughout the world connected by the Holy Spirit and like mindedness who share in the friendship and brotherhood of Jesus Christ. We do not necessarily attend the same church or live in the same city yet we share the same Lord.</description>

      <title>Cultivate Kingdom Worker Development Fund</title>

      <description>Cultivate’s mission is to develop kingdom workers, and we find the best way to do this is to help give young men and women opportunities where they can serve others in hands-on, practical ways while being coached in meaningful ways by loving leaders. For example, a senior engineering student wants to lead a team which deliberately focuses on students who would never come to church or a campus ministry. He wants to run the Alpha course because he knows it has structure and proven success at welcoming people who wouldn’t normally come.</description>

      <description>We believe that God works through individuals and teams to accomplish his purposes in the world - who we call kingdom workers. These people need well-established Christlike character to effectively love the people who they are called to love by God and advance his Kingdom in their lives. Through prayer, education, mentoring, and hands-on training, we at Cultivate develop people to grow God’s Kingdom.</description>

      <description>We believe our God is a God of specifics. He has a plan in mind for every person, creating everyone with particular work to do. In addition, God has specific ways He wants things done – there are essential qualities of justice, kindness, and excellence that go into every one of his plans. When someone listens for and clearly discerns the specific plan God gives, God’s Kingdom grows.</description>

      <title>Prayer</title>

      <description>Prayer often is the critical element of success in growing God’s Kingdom. No matter how gifted a person or team is, no matter how solid a plan is, success and failure rests on God’s favor. Our hope is to equip people and teams with initial groups who can petition God for guidance and success in their plans, as well as spiritually “cover” each individual who is working to grow God’s Kingdom.</description>
