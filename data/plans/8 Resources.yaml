title: Resources
description: Resources are the people, materials, and time necessary to see tactical success. Does the person doing the work have the information or training they need to be successful? Does this staff person or that volunteer need money to do a particular job effectively? Does that team or individual know the right people to help with their next critical endeavor, such as building a website, throwing an event, or crossing into a new cultural landscape? When a team or individuals have the resources they need, they can respond quickly and effectively, instead of having to pause to get the resources they need. Jesus always defines the resources we need, whether big or small - after all, He showed his followers how 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish were the resources needed to feed 5,000 people, and also showed that his body and blood were the resource needed to purchase our freedom.
