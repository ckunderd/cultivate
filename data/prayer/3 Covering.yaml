title: Covering
description: Covering is all about having people praying for individuals or teams as they do work that God loves, but that Satan hates. Satan will do all he can to kill and destroy those who try to grow God’s Kingdom, and it’s a wonderful blessing to have a group praying for spiritual protection and endurance in the face of a spiritual enemy.<br><br>In Luke 22, Jesus addresses his follower Simon Peter, saying “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” Jesus covered Simon Peter in prayer to God the Father, so that Simon Peter would persevere in the face of a significant spiritual obstacle. For all those like Simon Peter trying to grow God’s Kingdom, this kind of prayer is significant and important.
