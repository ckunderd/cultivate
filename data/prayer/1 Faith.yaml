description: Prayer often is the critical element of success in growing God’s Kingdom. No matter how gifted a person or team is, no matter how solid a plan is, success and failure rests on God’s favor. God is the one who has elevated slaves to positions of power and reduced kings to the depths of poverty. Those who are close to Him through the deep personal conversation of prayer have access to God’s power in ways others simply don’t. For those who seek to know him deeply in prayer, He can give critical insight into situations, help them discern the right direction at fork in the road moments, and move immovable obstacles with relative ease. <br><br>Our hope is to equip people and teams with initial groups who can petition God for guidance and success in their plans, as well as spiritually “cover” each individual who is working to grow God’s Kingdom. For people and teams we are assisting, we send out weekly prayer requests to our prayer teams, while also building prayer teams for each specific person or team by reaching out to new volunteers and teaching them how to communicate prayer needs to each other.
