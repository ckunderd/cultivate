I am extremely grateful for all the assistance I have received in this matter during this launch season. In these last 4 years, God has sent an incredible, wise, and resourceful team to Oakland University to help establish Cultivate, a ministry designed to develop kingdom workers. As defined by Jesus in Luke 10, a kingdom worker is a person of Christlike character - obedient to God, ready for any challenge, action-minded, and results-oriented - whose desire is to grow God’s Kingdom. Our team is dedicated to this mission, and we are excited to finally announce a way for you to partner with us in this vital work: the Cultivate Kingdom Worker Development Fund. Read on to find out about this exciting opportunity."

Cultivate’s mission is to develop kingdom workers, and we find the best way to do this is to help give young men and women opportunities where they can serve others in hands-on, practical ways while being coached in meaningful ways by loving leaders. For example, a senior engineering student wants to lead a team which deliberately focuses on students who would never come to church or a campus ministry. He wants to run the Alpha course because he knows it has structure and proven success at welcoming people who wouldn’t normally come. He looks at the Alpha course launch materials, and sees that a free meal is a primary component of offering the course to students he wants to reach. He knows they will come if a great dinner happens on campus, around where these students live. He longs to introduce them to Christ and grow God’s Kingdom in their hearts. However, he is a full time student working an additional 30-hour per week job. How does he, a 21 year old living on campus, get high quality food for 20, 30, or 40 people delivered to campus for 14 weeks to successfully invite those who would not be interested in a standard church setting? That’s where Cultivate, and specifically our Kingdom Worker Development Fund, comes in. With our expertise, community connections, and even our own hands, we can provide a consistent, quality meal for up to 35 students for $150 per week including delivery, as well as one-on-one mentoring and coaching for this student leader during the week. This leaves the student leader to do the “kingdom” work of building a team of volunteer table leaders, inviting non-Christian students, developing friendships, and eventually helping people declare Jesus as the Lord of their life who may never have desired to before.

This is one example, and it really happened in fall 2017. We have other amazing examples of how our Cultivate team has developed kingdom workers by helping them meaningfully serve others, understand their faith, facilitate discussions, start small groups, host events, and most importantly, grow in Christlike character.
