title: Petition
description: Jesus speaks so often about asking God for help. Humbling ourselves to ask God for success instead of figure it out ourselves is a critical component to being successful in any kingdom-growing endeavor. Here is Jesus speaking to his followers, “Keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who searches finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.”<br><br>Petition means to ask. Having a group of people who are routinely asking God for guidance, success, mercy, and forgiveness is invaluable to any team and to any plan if it’s going to accomplish what God wants it to accomplish.
