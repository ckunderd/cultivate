Over several years, Donna McCauley has developed friendships with men and women on the streets of Detroit and families who need encouragement in their faith. Donna, along with her 70x7 team of friends who have a long term commitment to encouraging others, spend time with these individuals and families on a weekly basis. Encouragement is given in the form of friendship, dignity, bible study, prayer and the meeting of a few basic needs, all with the view of helping individuals and families navigate away from at-risk activities and toward Jesus.

Donna knows the lives of the people she befriends. Having been forced into at-risk behavior during her own youth, she has a deep sense of empathy and love for those she encounters, and works diligently to ensure that her friends are not seen for their present circumstances but instead known by the value Jesus places on each of their lives. Her life and ministry are based on Jesus’ command to his followers to forgive those who wrong them not merely seven times, but seventy times seven, which is meant to signify that forgiveness never stops coming.
