title: Vision
description: <em>“Without revelation people run wild, but one who listens to instruction will be happy.” (Prov 29, verse 18)</em><br><br>A vision comes from revelation, a direct encounter with God. It is the picture that defines success, because it is the picture that God establishes and desires to see come to pass through our obedience. A vision is also informed by wisdom. We define biblical wisdom as living out the truth and character of God in context, and a vision is clarified by God’s word (truth and character), the setting where God wants to work (context), and the lives of the people who are carrying out the vision (living). A simple, clear, and articulate vision of what God wants to carry out helps people stay on course in the midst of heavy distraction or obstacles, helping people remain “happy” in all circumstances instead of “running wild.”
