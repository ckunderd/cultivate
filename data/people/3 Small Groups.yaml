title: Small groups
description: We offer a variety of groups depending on the needs of students. Sometimes it's the tried and true method of 12 step recovery, where students meet together with experienced leaders to go through the 12 steps in relation to areas of their life that they havenâ€™t submitted to the authority of God. Other times it could be a book study on boundaries, and most often, we use our version of the Root Lies exercise together with a tool called the Rational Self Analysis. Whatever the content, the desire is to see young men and women grow in the Christlike character they need to become kingdom workers who grow God's Kingdom.
