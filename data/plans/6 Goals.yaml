title: Goals
description: Tests are imperative to determine if our direction is accurate, and God uses them often to help shape and guide us. According to Romans 5, it is testing that produces perseverance, perseverance which produces character (or proof), and character that produces hope. In order to grow character, tests are a must, and goals define whether a test is successful or not. <br><br>Goals have different functions depending on how much time is involved; long-term and short-term goals serve very different purposes, but are both critical for determining if the strategy is working. In making goals, we use the acronym SMART to define an effective goal - is it Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-based? Goals that have these qualities help individuals or teams determine the work they need to do today to be successful tomorrow, next year, and ten years from now. Goals keep kingdom workers on track, so they can grow God's Kingdom effectively.
