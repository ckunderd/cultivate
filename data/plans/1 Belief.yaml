title: Belief
description: We believe our God is a God of specifics. He has a plan in mind for every person, creating everyone with particular work to do. In addition, God has specific ways He wants things done – there are essential qualities of justice, kindness, and excellence that go into every one of his plans. When someone listens for and clearly discerns the specific plan God gives, God’s Kingdom grows. We desire to see every kingdom worker employed in kingdom work.
