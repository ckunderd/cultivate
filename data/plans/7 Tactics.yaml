title: Tactics
description: A tactic is a word often attached to military operations. As Christians, we are in a spiritual battle with enemies, both seen and unseen all around us; we need to win each little battle in order to accomplish the larger task of establishing God's Kingdom on earth. <br><br>Tactics are the specific, day-to-day tasks that one must do to ensure that goals are met. How well a goal is accomplished often hinges on thorough attention to detail in the planning leading up to it. Is everything someone is doing today going to help reach the outcome of the goal? What else can we do to accomplish this goal with excellence? What does someone need to write / who do they need to call / what do they need to stop doing or postpone to make this next endeavor a great success? These are all tactical questions, and we see Jesus lead the way in thinking with great attention to detail. He was very concerned about who or what was directly in front of Him that day and how that interaction would help further his end goal.
