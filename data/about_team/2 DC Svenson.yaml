description: DC's passion for helping others understand the truth about who they are and who God is has led him to work extensively with people in understanding their true identity and refuting the lies they’ve believed by way of the “Root Tree Exercise.” DC also spends time leading men through in depth scripture studies to know Christ more intimately and transform their character to follow him in every way, and to challenge groups of students through his teachings to live in submission to God and to challenge every notion that is not from God. <br><br>In 2017, he began working with local youth part-time as a part of his ministry by way of teaching, discipleship and compassion. Around this time, God had been moving in his heart towards a men’s discipleship house and in July 2017, he was able to begin renting a house designed for that purpose. From there, the house has grown to have four men living there in a community built around the principles of the early church found in Acts 2 (a focus on God’s word, fellowship, prayer and breaking bread together). The house continues to attract more men who are looking for a place to live near campus that fosters this kind of community and serves as a meeting place for others who do not need a place to live, but want to experience that kind of community. <br><br>DC is fully supported by donations to fund his position within Cultivate.
