title: Mission
description: A mission statement defines the critical action(s) that need to happen in order to see the vision come to pass. In essence, it is the statement that says why each person involved exists in relation to the plan. If Jesus’ vision is God’s Kingdom on Earth as it is in heaven, then the mission would be to go and make disciples of all nations, teaching them everything that Jesus taught, and baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Great Commission gives each person a target toward which to go, reminding them of why they are doing what they are doing, as well as providing the foundation for how they do it. This statement defines exactly what needs to happen to see God’s Kingdom come into this world, and helps people focus on the work at hand instead of veering off course.
