description: Luke 10 is a critical chapter in understanding what qualities define a kingdom worker. Jesus tells his followers that the harvest is plentiful, and that workers are needed. His commands to these followers help define kingdom workers.<br><br><strong>Ready for any challenge</strong> (Luke 10:3) <br><em>“Now go, and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves.”</em><br>Jesus begins by telling them to go into dangerous situations, where they could be rejected, mocked, and ridiculed. This doesn’t stop the kingdom worker.<br><br><strong>Obedient to God (Luke 10:1-2)</strong><br><em>“Jesus now chose seventy-two other disciples…These were his instructions to them…”</em><br>Jesus gave instructions to his workers, and they followed all he gave them. Kingdom workers do what God asks, no matter the cost.<br><br><strong>Action-minded (Luke 10:9)</strong><br><em>“Heal the sick, and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God is near you now.’ ”</em><br>For the kingdom worker, it’s all about showing before telling. Jesus asks them to heal the sick, and then state their message. Action gives power to words.<br><br><strong>Results-oriented (Luke 10:11)</strong><br><em>“But if a town refuses to welcome you, go out into its streets and say, ‘…we have abandoned you to your fate. And know this—the Kingdom of God is near!’ ”</em><br>In the end, it’s all about the growth of God’s kingdom, nothing else. Kingdom workers focus on the end results, making sure they are hitting the target of the kingdom of God growing in the lives and hearts of individuals.
