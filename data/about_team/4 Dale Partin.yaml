description: Raised in a working class neighborhood in Toledo, OH, Dale's intellect and curiosity stood out from an early age. At 17, he remembers having a significant, pointed desire to know himself and others deeply, which led him to an eventual friendship with a classmate at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA where he was studying electrical engineering. This friend helped Dale truly understand the good news of Jesus Christ during sophomore year of college, and Dale never looked back in terms of his deep passion to know Jesus's plan for his life.<br><br>During graduate school, Dale married his wife Laina before graduating with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and Master's in Physics. He went on to work as a research scientist with Delphi, doing significant research in the automotive field. While working, Dale began to study his faith more in depth, and upon his retirement, began to take classes at Michigan Theological Seminary as well as lead adult spiritual formation classes at various churches, including his home church of Stoney Creek Community Church.<br><br>As Cultivate was in its infancy, Dale's passion to teach the next generation the ways of Jesus pushed him to become a student at Oakland University through an auditing program for retirees at Oakland University. While at Oakland, he joined the Cultivate team in late 2013, teaching bible studies, training student bible teachers, and developing classes like Bible 101, Spiritual Gifts, Hermeneutics, and Meeting Missionaries. <br><br>Dale and Laina have two sons who have each married, and they also have four grandchildren. They currently reside in Ray Township, MI.
