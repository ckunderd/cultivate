description: Kelly started with Cultivate in its first semester in 2013 as a freshman at Oakland. Coming from a missionary family, Kelly knew a lot about her faith, the bible, and the importance of reaching out and accepted Christ at a very young age. However, she still had her obstacles to overcome, in spite of her upbringing - the pressure of being a pastor/missionaries kid was one of those obstacles.<br><br>A fear of missing out on God’s promptings for her life was a prevailing obstacle by the time she made it to campus. As a successful student-athlete in high school, Kelly had a plan and direction for her life, but she was afraid of one day waking up and thinking she had missed or left God’s plan some place in the distant past. As a new freshman living away from home for the first time, this fear was fierce; still, she wanted help to put God first in her life.<br><br>In a divine connection, Kelly became connected with the Cultivate team. She was befriended, prayed over, and joined a women’s group. She participated in twice weekly faith discussions, and began to pray significantly on her own. In her second year, she began a relationship with a female mentor who she still spends time with 4 years later as she has begun graduate studies at Oakland. Kelly began to grow, and as a result, started to become a kingdom worker, desiring to serve others to show them the love of Christ. She began to look at campus organizations to see where she could be of assistance.<br><br>As a student-athlete at Oakland, Kelly formed relationships with members of her track team, and became a part of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA). During her junior year, she launched her first small group, inviting in several athletes who lived in her residence community on campus. One of the young women she invited was struggling deeply in her faith, but Kelly continually encouraged her, even when it sacrificing sleep for late night discussions and overcoming difficult circumstances. Two years later, that same young woman has rekindled her relationship with Jesus.<br><br>Kelly has encouraged dozens of students in her time at Oakland. From roommates, to friends, to athletes - Kelly is always looking for ways to grow God’s Kingdom in the hearts of others. Every summer from 2015-2017, Kelly has served as a leader on a local SpringHill Day Camps team in metro Detroit with other Oakland students, working primarily with special needs campers. Beginning in fall of 2016, she became president of FCA, working to establish and build up a faith community amongst Oakland athletes. In April 2017, she led an initiative to bring a worship concert to Oakland’s campus in an effort to unite various Christian organizations, and even now as a graduate student is investing in undergraduate students to help start new sport-specific small groups. <br><br>Cultivate offers Kelly valuable assistance and coaching as a kingdom worker amongst student athletes. Through the Kingdom Worker Development Fund, Cultivate has been able to help Kelly - and by extension of her leadership role, FCA - with outreach events, worship concert fees, leadership materials, and more - even offering to pay for Christian counseling for those struggling deeply with depression who Kelly was working to encourage. <br><br>Supporting the Cultivate Kingdom Worker Development Fund helps us get people like Kelly and the people she serves the help they need to be successful in growing God’s Kingdom.
