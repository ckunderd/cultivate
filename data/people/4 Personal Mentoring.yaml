title: Personal Mentoring
description: To simply be known by someone who is further along in the faith is often the best way of growing in Christlike character. We encourage and provide mentors for those seeking one-on-one counsel for character issues, relationships, confession, and prayer. One-on-one mentoring usually occurs once per week at a time of the student’s and mentor’s choosing.
